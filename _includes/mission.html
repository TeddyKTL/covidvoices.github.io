                  Everyday, news agencies provide us with numbers on infected people. Everyday, political leaders give us updates on COVID-19 policies.<br>
                  However, nobody ever tells us what day-to-day life for people affected by COVID-19 is really like.<br>
                  Teddy and his team aim to change that. This summer, we are on a journey talking to 100 people across all 50 US states trying to understand people and hoping to find answers to the real questions:<br>
                  What does it mean if you are one of the 3% + of people who filed for unemployment?<br>
                  Where do you self-isolate if you don’t have a home?<br>
                  How do you feel after having suddenly lost a loved one?<br>
                  We don’t want to tell a story, we want to listen to your story. Our videos and podcasts are unguided and provide people with an opportunity to share what is important to them.<br>
                  We focus on one major question:<br>
                  What do you want to share about COVID-19 with the world?<br>
